# Potato-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project addresses the significant issue of economic loss and crop waste faced by farmers due to various diseases in potato plants. By leveraging deep learning techniques, I have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images of potato plants to determine whether they are diseased or healthy.

Project Highlights:

Objective: To create a model that can identify diseases in potato plants from images, aiding farmers in early detection and intervention.
Approach: Utilized a deep learning architecture, specifically a CNN, for image classification, trained on a dataset of labeled images of potato plants.

Technology Stack:
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training the CNN model)
Data Handling: NumPy, pandas (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
