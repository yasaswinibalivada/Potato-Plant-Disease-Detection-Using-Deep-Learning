# Potato-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project addresses the significant issue of economic loss and crop waste faced by farmers due to various diseases in potato plants. By leveraging deep learning techniques, I have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images of potato plants to determine whether they are diseased or healthy.
